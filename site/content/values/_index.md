      Super Cheap Towing only have professional and qualified vehicle recovery
      operators on the team and all of our drivers have recovery experience. 
      Because our industry has such a specialised nature, it is essential that
      all tow truck drivers are highly qualified.


      We train our staff to look after your best interest, your vehicle. No
      matter the situation.  Whether its a breakdown, accident,  or a vehicle
      recovery, we can recover and remove your vehicle with no stress, and no
      further damage to your vehicle.


      Some vehicle salvages require extra care and experience to safely recover
      your vehicle. To ensure a safe tow our drivers will always conduct an
      onsite assessment upon arrival and will explain what is required before
      starting the vehicle recovery.
